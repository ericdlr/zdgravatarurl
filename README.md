zdGavatarURL
Put a Gravatar in your applications
=============

zdGravatarURL is a class written in Xojo. It allows you to use the gravatar.com API by generating the URL needed to retrieve a Gravatar member's avatar given his/her email address. It works with all Xojo's targets: Desktop, Console, Web.

zdGravatarURL can handle all functionalities built in the Gravatar API for avatar:

 * No email address embedded in the generated URL. Only a 128 bits hash
 * The avatar's size can be customized from 1 pixel up to 2048 pixels
 * Use predefined default avatars or your own custom picture if the address email is unknown to Gravatar's server
 * The display of the default avatar can be forced for testing purpose
 * 4 rating levels available for returned avatar: G, PG, R, X
 * A secured URL ( 'https://' ) can be generated if needed
 * Optional file-type extension .jpg on demand for compatibility purpose
 * No needs of an API key for your application and no subscription required

Since version 1.3, zdGravatarURL is hosted by GitHub at this URL:
